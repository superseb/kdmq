# kdmq (kdm query)

Tool to query KDM data for a given Rancher version, think of:

- What k8s version are included in a Rancher release (channel `embedded`), out of band (channel `release`) or in development (channel `dev`)?
- What k8s images are in a Rancher Kubernetes version?
- What addons are included in a Rancher Kubernetes version?

And diff commands to automatically get the differences between two version.
